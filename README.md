# computing-work
The air was still on a cold winter sunday, i was walking on the road and i suddenly fell into the drain
in the drain i saw it
it was a clown with sharp teeth and ugly face
come here little kiddo he said
i ran all the way to the end of the drain to escape 
but he ran so fast that it only took him one second to reach me
i though i was going to die as he would eat me up
just then i heard construction workers coming into the drain to check if there was anyone in it 
they shined a torch at the clown and the clown died
i was rescued out of the drain today by the construction workers
what a close shave today!
